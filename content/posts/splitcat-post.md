# Splitcat: An App for Easy File Splitting and Merging

Iâ€™m excited to introduce my latest project â€“ **Splitcat**! ðŸŽ‰ After a lot of work, the app is now **fully developed in Flutter** and ready for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/vogonwann/splitcat) and [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/lol.janjic.Splitcat).

## About the App

Splitcat is built entirely in **Flutter**, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience on both desktop and mobile platforms. It simplifies **file splitting and merging**, making it easier to manage large files without needing complex command-line tools.

Some typical use cases include:  
- **Splitting large files** into smaller chunks for sharing via email or uploading to platforms with size limits.  
- **Merging chunks back** into the original file seamlessly.  

With **ARM64 support**, Splitcat runs perfectly on **Linux phones** like those with **postmarketOS** or **mobian**.

## Key Features

- **Preset and Custom Split Options:** Choose predefined chunk sizes for specific apps or create your own.  
- **Simple and Intuitive UI:** Designed with a minimal layout, including large buttons for easy navigation, especially on smaller screens.  
- **Multi-Platform Support:** Flutter enables compatibility across desktops and Linux phones alike.  
- **Flatpak Package:** Available on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/) for hassle-free installation on various Linux distributions.
